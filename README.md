Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the steps to build a Docker image for this Python Flask application. It starts with the official Python Docker image, installs Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt, copies application code, exposes port 5005, and specifies the command to run the Flask application.


Building the Docker image: Use docker build command to build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile.
Running the Docker container: Use docker run command to start the Docker container and run the Flask application.
Accessing the application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5005 to interact with the running Flask application.
